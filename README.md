# 🧠 ProfessorChrome — AI-Powered Writing & Paraphrase Coach

ProfessorChrome is an intelligent writing companion designed for **students** and
**Teachers**.  
It doesn’t just rewrite — it _teaches you how to write better._  
Built using Chrome’s **Writer**, **Rewriter**, **Proofreader**, and **Prompt** APIs, it acts like a virtual professor right in your browser.

## 🚀 Overview

**ProfessorChrome** helps students improve their paraphrasing, letter writing, and composition skills through **guided, AI-powered feedback**.

Teachers can upload questions and model answers, while students attempt their own responses.  
The system compares both answers, analyzes **context, grammar, tone, and structure**, and provides **step-by-step feedback** showing _why_ and _how_ to improve.
